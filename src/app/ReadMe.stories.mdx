# 🪴 My Herbarium

# 🧭 Context

The **My Herbarium** project is done to address the Preply recruitment exercice. This document is the main docs requested as a deliverable. This document was build using [a Notion site](https://denim-crocus-d10.notion.site/My-Herbarium-a682616c38c244618999e437a327bbf0) (try it for more interactions).

## 🪚 What has been done

- The [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/vFCIVv7NPw1IqHBcBBWl6h/My-Herbarium?type=design&node-id=14-1126&mode=design&t=IaRLAeBgdWr2mLuC-0) has been extended with:
  - The definition of design tokens, one color has been added for convenience.
  - The specification for `<Badge />`, `<Slider />`, `<FlowerCard />` components and `<Home />` page.
- Tasks can be found at the end of this document in the Project Management section, they have been defined to address both:
  - The short term goal: provide a prototype for user tests.
  - The long term goal: provide a demo application on the Internet (not completely functional yet but usable).
- The [code](https://github.com/nicoinch/my-herbarium) has been written to satisfy the short term goal only according to the tasks previously defined. Long term guidance can be found in pending tasks.

## 📦 Deliverables

- This markdown file also available as [a Notion site](https://denim-crocus-d10.notion.site/My-Herbarium-a682616c38c244618999e437a327bbf0) (try it for more interactions).
- A [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/vFCIVv7NPw1IqHBcBBWl6h/My-Herbarium?type=design&node-id=14-1126&mode=design&t=IaRLAeBgdWr2mLuC-0) with original designs and some additions.
- The code implemented both as files in the delivered archive and as [a Github repository](https://github.com/nicoinch/my-herbarium) (useful to see all the dev processes with commits & pull requests).
- The Storybook deployed on Chromatic with both:
  - Stories for components and page.
  - Stories for user tests: Stories have been implemented to satisfy the scenario provided. Variations have been put in place to be able to test the pertinence of the description and the two possible titles (**My Herbarium** & **Your Herbarium**):

# 💼 Project

## **🔭** Project vision

The **My Herbarium** application will allow users to monitor their plants at home via dedicated IOT sensors. Users will be able to add and remove plants, associate temperature and humidity sensors, and adjust each plant’s light and humidity levels.

The application will support dark mode. All the data will be stored in the device, except for the real time data from the herbarium sensors, which will be provided by an API.

## ❓Questions for product owner & design

⚠️ In a real life project, those questions would have been answered ASAP and should have blocked certain tasks. For the sake of the exercise, I tried to provide solutions on my own.

- Wireframes refers to **_Your Herbarium_** when product vision refers to **_My Herbarium_**, which one is correct? _For now, the product vision name has been used, but can be renamed._
- Layout screenshots and flowers data have a plant description property missing in the Figma file and not mentioned in the user testing scenario. _It has been added to the `<FlowerCard />` component in Figma and implemented but is hidden thanks to a component prop, will be removed once proper behaviour is identified._
- In the provided data, pictures are missing for Chrysanthemum & Zinnia. _Replaced with pictures found online._
- Icons for sun, crossed out sun, droplet and crossed out droplet were not provided. _Extracts from the Figma file are used instead._
- A typo is present on the provided flowers data (`humidty` instead of `humidity`). _Used a fixed version in the code._
- The `<Slider />` as this presents a usability issue as the current value is not displayed. If the user wants to precisely tune the values, as requested in the usability test, it will be difficult. _A popover has been added when sliding to display the current value._

## 💄 UI Design

[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/vFCIVv7NPw1IqHBcBBWl6h/My-Herbarium?type=design&node-id=14-1126&mode=design&t=IaRLAeBgdWr2mLuC-0) with:

- The original provided design .
- The design tokens.
- The components `<Badge />`, `<Slider />` and `<FlowerCard/>`.
- The `<Home />` page.

## **🧑‍💻 Implementation**

The application has been implemented using:

- [React](https://react.dev/)/[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the web application code,
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling,
- [NX](https://nx.dev/) to generate the application and manage tools addition,
- [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for accessible components,
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a development workshop,
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) for visual testing and Storybook deployment,
- [Github](https://github.com/) to manage sources: ‣.
